3. In BlueJ, go to the top left and click Project -> Open ZIP/JAR... and select the jar file you just downloaded
4. Right click the box named TitlePage -> Compile
5. Right click TitlePage -> void main(String[] args)
6. The game should now be running
7. If you close the game, follow step 5 to run the game again
